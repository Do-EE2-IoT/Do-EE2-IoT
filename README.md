## 🚀 About Me

I am an Embedded & IoT Engineer with strong experience in **firmware development**, **embedded Linux**, and **smart home systems**. I have worked across the full stack of IoT products — from low-level drivers and RTOS tasks to gateways and cloud integration.

I enjoy building **reliable, production-grade embedded systems** and optimizing firmware for performance, stability, and power efficiency.
